# Facebook Messenger Chat Widget (beta)

## Description

This extension allows you to deploy a Facebook Messenger widget connected to your Facebook page, enabling you to extend your Facebook Messenger services to any web page with Optimizely.

Simply enter your Facebook Page ID, APP ID, and select the greeting text and theme color and you can add this widget to any page via an experiment or personalization campaign with Optimizely.

For more information on this feature from Facebook see the [developer docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/customer-chat-plugin).

Additionally, if you wish to learn more about how to experiment with a Facebook Messenger bot using Optimizely Full Stack, see this [blog post](https://blog.optimizely.com/2017/10/03/build-messenger-bot-node/).
