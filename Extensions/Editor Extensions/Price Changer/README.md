## Description

Extension that gives the ability to change prices for products site wide either by a discrete or a percentage amount. 

__Please Note:__ This Extension is an example of how you can easily change prices in the UI that your visitors will see. This doesn't change the actual price in your backend code, so the original price will be charged if you don't change this in your backend. Also note that you might have to change the selector of the element that contains the prices in the _Apply JS_.

## Fields

* Price Change Type
* Price Change Amount
