# Moat Analytics

## Description

Use this integration to track your Optimizely experiments in Moat Analytics using the Optimizely Experiment filter view within Moat. The integration works by creating and populating an optimizelyMoat object on the page, which Moat's JS will consume when loaded. The integration depends on Optimizely being loaded Synchronously above the Moat tag on the page.
